Summary: I attended another hackathon!

Hamp Hack 2017 was the third hackathon I ever attended.  On the bus ride over, I eagerly found guides on web development in Flask to provide my teammates.  My three teammates, John Bojorquez from Google, Tony Pham from Pratt and Whitney, and Julie Pham, all were newcomers to hackathons.  It was my job to show them a good time and help make their first hackathon a good one.
